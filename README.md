jawamp
======

**jawamp** is Just Another JAva implementation of [WAMP](http://wamp.ws/ "WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol").
My goal is to make java WAMP support library as simple and compact as possible providing access to all levels of WAMP
processing as well. Sometimes you just have to dive deeper â€” handle connection termination or publish events on server.

Quick start
-----------

No public repo available. Deploy jawamp on local machine or server (take a look at [Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/home/v_artifactory_opensource_overview)).

Add jawamp dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.rgmih</groupId>
    <artifactId>jawamp</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

NOTE: jawamp depends on `slf4j-api` and `gson`. In tests jawamp uses [jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/) as transport.
